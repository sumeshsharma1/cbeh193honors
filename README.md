# Sumesh Sharma's CBE H193 Honors Thesis for Mesbah Lab

iPython Notebooks hosted on Google Colab server for Sumesh Sharma's CBE H193 Honors Thesis
Case Studies Include:
  - Analysis of TF-A Transcription Factor in Mammalian Cells
  - Analysis of her1 gene expression in zebrafish
  - Analysis of STAT monomer/dimer concentrations in the JAK2/STAT5 cell signaling pathway

The thesis explores using nonintrusive generalized polynomial chaos and extended Kalman filters
to accurately account for time invariant uncertainties and stochastic noise within these systems.
The files in this repository serve as "benchmarks" for comparing these methods (which themselves
are modeled in MATLAB) and determining accuracy. Due to the large computational power needed to run 
the benchmarked Monte Carlo simulations, these files are hosted as iPython notebooks and are run
using the Google Colab server.
