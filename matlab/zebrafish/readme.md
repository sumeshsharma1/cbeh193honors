A lot of things going on here so let me try to explain, as this was the hardest case study of all 3 to implement and get results from. zebrafishvariables.m uses Hermite polynomials to get inner product vectors for both states, and zebrafishnonintrusive.m uses nonintrusive gPC to propagate uncertainty through the system and solve for the states in the absence of stochastic noise. ekf.m and ekf2.m essentially do the same thing, but at different timesteps, which involves running the system through an extended Kalman filter that linearizes it and accounts for the stochastic noise. zebtotalvar.m and zebtotalvar2.m use the novel method presented in the thesis to account for uncertainty and stochastic noise and solves for the variance of each state in the system. All of the matlab files that have "benchmark" in their names have data imported from iPython notebook results for better/more consistent visualization. All of the .mat files were vectors/matrices that were locally saved to make computation faster.
