nonintrusive.m propagates through uncertainties in this 1-state system using nonintrusive 
gPC, switch at t=200 is accounted for. gpcomega10.m calculates basis functions for this system while montecarlo.m is used for validation and benchmarking. This is the only case study where the validation was done on MATLAB and not iPython notebook because it was relatively low computation.
